# cpp-project-oops

So, I have implemented sql in c++ using the concepts of OOPS. Main motive behind it was as Oracle DB doesn't exist for Mac M1/M2 devices. So, are small workaround the issue.
To compile it
Open the folder in terminal then
```
g++  main.cpp -o test
./test
```

Main issues at hand are nested selects and a bit of updating. Other than it, Everything's fine.!!

Have a great Day!!
